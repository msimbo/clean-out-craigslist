# Clean Out craigslist.org
## General Info
Using my UI/UX Balsamiq wireframe mockup that I did on a prior craigslist.org assignment,
I implemented my design using Tailwind CSS as my framework.

## Problem
The boston.craigslist.org webpage isn't visually pleasing for visitors.
The reason is that there are too much text crammed into the page.

## Process and Solution
To solve this problem, I reduced the amount of text above the fold and moved the different category and section around the page.
From my mockup, I design the Nav bar with a bigger logo and a search bar. On the original site, the search bar is located on the left column of the site.
There are more white spaces to reduce the text being crowded. For the "Nearby Craigslist" left column, I make it scrollable. Kept the text color similar to the original, because it still looks good.
After completion, I uploaded to GitHub and deployed on vercel.
